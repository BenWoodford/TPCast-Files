# Templates

This folder contains links to the full SD card backups (see below) for various TPCast components, as well as the folder of files used to setup a base Raspbian install for TPCast use.

# Setup Templates

These are just the setup files found on the TPCast SD card, running the setup-4.x.x.sh file should be sufficient to setup a vanilla install of Raspbian for TPCast use.

**Warning**: We do not recommend running the setup on a kernel that does not match the version in the setup script's filename.

- [Pre-release Edition Setup Files](4.4.19-tp-moid-str-new-PRE/)

# Full SD Card Images

These are full backups of every partition on the SD card, something like `dd` on Linux/macOS or [Win32 Disk Imager](https://sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager/) should be used to restore them.
