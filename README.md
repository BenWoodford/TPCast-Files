Warning to anyone who intends to use my image, I have not changed or removed the SSID and password from my image, so be sure to change it to whatever yours should be (its on the power box label, or you can try changing it to whatever you want) by editing the WiFi config file on the SDcard before you stick it back in your TPcast, lest you find yourself unable to get it to connect to your access point after copying the image to the SDcard and trying to boot your TPcast with it.
